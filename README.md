# Calculator
Infix/Postfix Calculator                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
This program creates a Calculator class to evaluate infix and postfix expressions. It utilizes a Scanner class, created by Sam Donow and Morgan McGuire, to read input from the user. Infix expressions are converted to postfix utilizing Dijkstra's Shunting Yard Algorithm, and postfix expressions are evaluated into output utilizing a standard algorithm.                                                                                                                                                   
Currently the following operators are supported: {+, -, *, /}                                                                                                                            
Note that postfix expressions should be inputted with spaces between each token.
